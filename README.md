# Hello friends!

## I used to dig holes for a living.

Now, I create full-stack applications and web sites! I'm just a guy who's not afraid to roll up his sleeves and get his hands dirty; looking to take his passion and experience in building incredible things from the ground up and leverage it in the world of software engineering. Self-taught programmer who recently graduated App Academy's 24 week, full-stack Javascript / Python bootcamp.
